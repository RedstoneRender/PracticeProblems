The problem:

  write a program that will print out the numbers 0 through 99.
  when the program prints a number that is a multiple of 3, print out fizz in addition to the number.
  when the program prints a number that is a multiple of 5, print out buzz in addition to the number.
  when the program prints a number that is a multiple of 3 and 5, print out fizzbuzz in addition to the number.

  You may not print out fizz or buzz more than once per number-I.e:

    valid:
      15
      fizzbuzz

    invalid:
      15
      fizz
      buzz
      fizzbuzz

    valid:
      10
      buzz

    invalid:
      10
      fizzbuzz

  send me your code (just make sure I don't have to indent anything manually to make it work please) and I will check it and point out issues.
  My solution is 8 lines long and was written in probably 45 seconds.

Relevant information (I assumed I needed to explain everything this was before I asked what you knew):

  The modulus operator (%):

    the modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

    10 % 2 gives 0 (10 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0)
    21 % 8 gives 5 (21 divided by 8 has a remainder of 5)
    1 % 2 gives 1 (1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1)

    example:
      x = 5 % 2
      print(x)

    output:
      1

  If statements:

    if statements evaluate the expression after the if keyword and before the ':' symbol and execute the code in the block if the expression evaluates to true

    example:

      if 2 > 1:
          print(10)

      if 10 < 5:
          print(20)

    output:
      10

  Elif statements:

    elif statements are short for else if. They are only evaluated if the condition preceding them evaluates to false and if their condition evaluates to true

    example:

      if 2 > 1:
          print(10)
      elif 10 > 2:
          print(20)

    output:
      10

    example 2:

      if 2 < 1:
          print(10)
      elif 10 > 2:
          print(20)

    output:
      20

  Else statements:

    else statements only run the code in the block if the none of the if and elif statements preceding them evaluated to true

    example:

      if 2 > 1:
          print(10)
      elif 10 > 2:
          print(20)
      else:
          print(30)

    output:
      10

    example 2:

      if 2 < 1:
          print(10)
      elif 10 > 2:
          print(20)
      else:
          print(30)

    output:
      20

    example 3:

      if 2 < 1:
          print(10)
      elif 1 > 2:
          print(20)
      else:
          print(30)

    output:
      30
